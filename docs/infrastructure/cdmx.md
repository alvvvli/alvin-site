## ðŸš  Mexico City: Integration Builds Resilience

Entire hillside communities, once isolated, are now **colorfully linked into the cityâ€™s core**.

Each cable span represents a **data-driven decision** â€” optimizing gradient, flow, and capacity â€” to bring access where ground transit couldnâ€™t.  
This is **mobility as social infrastructure**, turning geography into opportunity.  

A reminder that supply chains and urban networks share the same truth:  
**integration builds resilience.**
