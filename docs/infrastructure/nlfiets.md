Cycling in the Netherlands isn’t just transport — it’s a **live model of applied logistics**.  
Every design element, from intersection geometry to signal timing, reflects **systemic flow engineering** rather than just urban aesthetics.

### ⚙️ Flow Design in Practice
- **Timed crossings and adaptive signals**: Many urban junctions use **sensor-based actuation** that balances cyclist platoons with vehicle phases, minimizing idle time and improving average network velocity.  
- **Grade separation and curvature control**: Underpasses, elevated bridges, and wide corner radii maintain **momentum continuity**, reducing braking energy loss and cyclist fatigue.  
- **Roundabout geometry**: Cyclist-priority roundabouts are **radius-optimized (15–25 m)** for predictable speed envelopes, designed to prevent cross-traffic interference while maximizing throughput.  

### 🧭 Infrastructure as a Supply Chain
Each intersection operates as a **micro-hub**, synchronizing throughput the same way a **supply chain** aligns material flow.  
Efficiency here isn’t about raw speed — it’s about **predictable rhythm**, **spatial redundancy**, and **human-centered kinematics**.  

This is logistics at an urban scale — where the principle of *flow efficiency* extends beyond freight to everyday human mobility.
