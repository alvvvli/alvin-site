ðŸŒ‰ **Tokyo Rainbow Bridge**  

- **798 m main span** clears maritime traffic into Tokyo Bay.  
- **126 m towers** designed low to stay beneath **Haneda Airportâ€™s air corridor**.  
- **Double-deck design** carries both road and rail, integrating expressways with public transit.  
- **Spiral loop** climbs **40 m** to connect seamlessly within the densest urban fabric.  

---

### Technical Highlights
- **Structural dual-use** â†’ upper deck (Shuto Expressway) + lower deck (Yurikamome Line + local road).  
- **Airspace integration** â†’ tower height constrained by aviation limits, solved with optimized suspension geometry.  
- **Seismic resilience** â†’ foundation and cable design adapted for Tokyoâ€™s seismic conditions.  
- **Urban logistics efficiency** â†’ reduces congestion by linking Odaiba, central Tokyo, and Haneda approaches.  
- **Iconic yet functional** â†’ aesthetic lighting synchronized with urban skyline, reinforcing infrastructure as part of Tokyoâ€™s identity.

These numbers arenâ€™t just specs â€” they are **quiet proof of how Tokyo builds resilience into every curve**.
