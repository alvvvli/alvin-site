🖥️ **TSMC's Foundry Model — from vision to dominance**  

In the 1980s, **Morris Chang** pitched a radical idea:  
separate **design, wafer fabrication, and packaging/testing** — making wafer fabs the **capital-intensive backbone** of the industry.  

These early **VLSI pitch decks** revealed a new paradigm, setting the stage for today’s **global foundry model**.  

Walking past **Fab 18 in Tainan today**, it’s striking how that vision scaled into the **center of modern semiconductors**.

### Technical + Industry Highlights
- **Foundry model** → fabless companies (Qualcomm, Nvidia, Apple) focus on design, outsourcing production to fabs.  
- **Capital intensity** → advanced fabs require >$20B per site, with cutting-edge EUV tools.  
- **Process innovation** → scaling from micron-level VLSI in the 1980s to today’s 3nm/2nm production nodes.  
- **Global supply chain** → TSMC sits at the nexus of design (US/EU), fabrication (Taiwan), and packaging/testing (Asia-wide).  
- **Strategic infrastructure** → fabs are no longer just factories — they are **geopolitical assets** anchoring national security and technology policy.

From **visionary pitch decks** to **world-dominating infrastructure**, TSMC reshaped how semiconductors are built — and how global supply chains are structured.
