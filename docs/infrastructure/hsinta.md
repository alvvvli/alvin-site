Thanks to **Kayne Huang** for bringing me to the frontlines at **Hsinta Power Plant**  
for his QA session with TaiPower’s 熱機組 (Thermal Machinery Unit)  
on **new item list purchases** under the Taiwan Power Company procurement system.  

This was a close look at how **sales, supply chain, and operations** converge in practice:  

- QA reviews shaping procurement decisions  
- Item lists linked directly to turbine lifecycle needs  
- Collaboration with TaiPower’s engineering team to align technical precision with execution  

### Reflection  
Witnessing the dialogue between OEM suppliers and TaiPower’s operations team underscored how  
**energy reliability depends as much on procurement discipline as on engineering performance.**
