Thanks to Andy, Kun-Cheng Tseng, Mary, Pei Ching, Eddie Lin, Clair Lin, and the Taiwan **FieldCore** team for bringing me into a rare gas turbine major inspection at central Taiwan's StarBuck plant.  

## Technical Insights

This inspection involved:  
- **Full rotor lift & casing separation** for internal access  
- **Component-level checks** on blades, vanes, and seals for wear and fatigue  
- **Field coordination** across tooling, lifting, and clearance sequences  
- **Execution timing** designed to minimize downtime and ensure rapid reassembly

Typical metrics for major inspections:  
- Scheduled every **24,000‚Äì32,000 equivalent operating hours** (approx. 3‚Äì4 years for baseload units)  
- **2‚Äì4 weeks outage duration**, depending on scope and parts replacement  
- Covers turbines rated up to **300+ MW** output, with tolerances measured down to **microns**  

A close look at turbine disassembly, field coordination, and real-time execution response ‚Äî showing the kind of precision and dedication that's hard to grasp without extended onsite exposure.  

Grateful to witness how **GE Vernova** drives operational excellence where it counts most.
