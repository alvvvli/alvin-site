Thanks to Andy, Kun-Cheng Tseng, Mary, Pei Ching, Eddie Lin, Clair Lin, and the Taiwan **FieldCore** team for bringing me into a rare gas turbine major inspection at central Taiwan's StarBuck plant. 

## 🔧 Technical Insights

- **Major inspection cycle:** typically every **24,000–32,000 equivalent operating hours**  
- **Scope:** full rotor lift, casing separation, hot gas path component checks  
- **Outage duration:** **2–4 weeks** depending on findings and parts availability  
- **Scale:** turbines rated up to **300+ MW**, tolerances measured in **microns**  
- **Objective:** extend service life, ensure reliability, and restore peak efficiency  

A close look at turbine disassembly, field coordination, and real-time execution response — showing the kind of precision and dedication that's hard to grasp without extended onsite exposure.  

Grateful to witness how **GE Vernova** drives operational excellence where it counts most.
