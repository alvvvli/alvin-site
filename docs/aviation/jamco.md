- **Passenger experience engineering** → ergonomics, crashworthiness, and in-seat systems (IFE, power modules) designed for reliability and comfort.  
- **Global supply chain orchestration** → production involves multi-region manufacturing hubs and specialized component suppliers (composite frames, actuators, textiles).  
- **Certification pathway** → compliance with EASA/FAA CS-25 requirements for safety, flammability, and load performance.
