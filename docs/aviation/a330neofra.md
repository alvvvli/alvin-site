✈️ **A330neo left wing, Frankfurt Airport.**  

The **A330neo** integrates next-generation wing technology adapted from the A350 program:  

- **Extended span with Sharklets** → reduces induced drag, improving aerodynamic efficiency  
- **High-lift devices** → optimized for lower approach speeds and shorter runway performance  
- **Composite structures** → lighten weight while ensuring durability and fatigue resistance  
- **Fuel efficiency gains** → ~25% reduction in burn compared to legacy A330ceo aircraft  

Seen here on Condor’s fleet, the left wing is more than structure — it’s an engineered balance of lift, drag, and resilience that defines modern long-haul economics.
