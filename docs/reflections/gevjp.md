This exchange showed me how global operations are built not only on technical precision,  
but also on trust and collaboration across cultures.  

大変お世話になりました — I’m grateful for the chance to learn from Japan’s perspective  
while bridging my experiences from Taiwan and the U.S.  

## Reflection
Moments like these remind me that engineering and supply chain execution  
are sustained by people working seamlessly across borders.
