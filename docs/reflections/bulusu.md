In **CIVENG 260: Air Transportation**, taught by Dr. [Vishwa Bulusu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishwanathbulusu/) â€” Senior Aerospace Scientist at NASA Ames â€” the most valuable lessons werenâ€™t equations alone, but how to think like an engineer:

- **Solve problems, not just assignments**: cross-cutting, interdisciplinary applications matter most.  
- **Build small, then scale**: iterate, test, and repeat until systems are robust.  
- **Treat failure as an ally**: persistence and commitment outweigh grades in the long run.  

These takeaways became real while working on our **Siemens Tecnomatix airport AGV simulation**. Under time pressure, I learned that structured problem-solving and repeated iteration deliver results â€” not shortcuts.  

Iâ€™m grateful for the mentorship and perspective Dr. Bulusu shared. Itâ€™s humbling to be reminded that engineering excellence is built less on perfect grades, and more on **rigor, dedication, and applied creativity**.
