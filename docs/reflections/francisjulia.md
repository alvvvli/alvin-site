Grateful for the mentorship and insights from **Francis Lim**, GE Vernova's Regional Parts & Repairs Director, and **Julia Chen**, Senior Parts Sales Manager.  

Their guidance continues to shape how I approach both the technical and human sides of supply chain execution. From high-stakes negotiations to the discipline of parts validation, every conversation reinforced that expertise is built not only through data, but through years of applied judgment.  

### Reflection  
- **Francis Lim**: Demonstrated how long-cycle turbine parts and repairs require patience, cross-border coordination, and deep customer trust â€” strategy built over decades.  
- **Julia Chen**: Showed how precision in parts sales, from coding to contract detail, underpins operational resilience and supports regional turbine fleets in real time.  

> For me, the lesson is clear: operational excellence isnâ€™t achieved by rushing outcomes, but by consistently applying rigor, humility, and care in the details that keep systems running.
