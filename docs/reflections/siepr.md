Hearing visionaries like **Jim Farley (Ford)** and **Jensun Huang (NVIDIA)** share on the future of automobiles, AI, and policy was both inspiring and grounding.

Their perspectives on customer experience, mobility, and Taiwan's strategic role in NVIDIA's global trajectory offered rare insight—reinforced in the brief exchanges beyond the stage.

Nearly two years later, the lessons stay sharp: there is always more to learn, and the value lies in perspectives that shape the top of industry and policy alike.
