### Technical Insights
- **Gradient management**: optimized traction and braking logic across steep altitudes.  
- **Thermal resilience**: rolling stock and tunnel design adapted for arid climate transitions.  
- **Intermodal continuity**: seamless rail link between Jerusalem’s mountain core and Tel Aviv’s coastal plain.  
- **Systems integration**: synchronizing power, signaling, and passenger flow under extreme elevation profiles.

A strong case of **logistics-minded rail engineering** — precision and reliability maintaining continuity through topographical challenge.
