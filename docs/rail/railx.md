🚦 **Railway crossings in Japan blend safety with engineering discipline.**  

Every crossing integrates:  
- **Obstacle detection sensors** — detect vehicles or pedestrians on tracks.  
- **Emergency stop buttons** wired to interlocking — giving the public direct intervention power.  
- **Fail-safe logic (default = danger)** — if a system fault occurs, trains are stopped.  
- **Standardized barriers & alert sequences** — lights, bells, and arms in a predictable, rehearsed pattern.

### Why it matters
Rail crossings here are more than transport nodes.  
They represent **risk engineering embedded into daily flow**, showing how design transforms everyday danger into managed safety.  

It’s **systems thinking at street level**: small, repeatable interventions scaling into national reliability.
