Not every day you get to sit in the driver's seat of the world's most advanced trains.

At **InnoTrans Berlin**, I had the rare chance to:

- Operate a **Stadler FLIRT Akku** battery train  
- Close **Siemens ICE** doors bound for **Egyptian National Railways'** first high-speed rail  
- Test **Alstom's** new 50m trams for **Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG)**  

A hands-on look into the precision behind European rail innovation.

> Every lever, every touchscreen, every iconic beep is part of the discipline that keeps millions moving daily.
