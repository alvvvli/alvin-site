🎵 **Okinawa Monorail departure melodies — engineered harmony.**  

At **Okinawa Airport**, the traditional 谷茶前 melody isn't just music.  

It's:  
- **Cognitive load reduction** (distinct tunes per stop)  
- **Stress modulation** (short, calming phrasing)  
- **Cultural anchoring** (Tokyo vs. Okinawa)  
- **Operational timing** (clear window for boarding flow)  

Seconds of sound — crafted to move people **safely, calmly, and in harmony** with their journey.
