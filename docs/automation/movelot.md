ðŸ¤– **MOVeLOT Inc.â€™s humanoid manipulator**, presented at **SusHi Tech Tokyo 2025** under the sponsorship of the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government**.  

A demonstration of how **teleoperation merges with mobility** â€” framing robotics not only as standalone machines but as part of **urban infrastructure systems**.  

### Technical Highlights  
- **Teleoperation** â†’ operator-controlled manipulators via low-latency communication links.  
- **Dexterous end-effectors** â†’ humanoid hands designed for fine manipulation tasks in public and industrial settings.  
- **Mobility integration** â†’ robotic arms mounted on mobile platforms, enabling deployment in transport hubs or service environments.  
- **Urban application** â†’ potential use cases include passenger assistance, logistics handling, and emergency support within Tokyoâ€™s infrastructure.  
- **Policy framework** â†’ supported by city-level government initiatives promoting robotics as a public utility layer.  

This exhibit signals Japanâ€™s vision of robotics as **infrastructure-grade technology**, bridging human control with autonomous mobility.
