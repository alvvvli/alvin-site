➡️ Prior to graduating from UC Berkeley, I self-taught **Siemens Tecnomatix** to build a digital twin of an airport baggage system integrating AGVs.

Guided by Dr. [Vishwanath Bulusu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishwanathbulusu/) (NASA Ames), the simulation demonstrated measurable efficiency gains over baseline conveyor systems, highlighting scalable potential for faster airport turnaround and reduced delays.
