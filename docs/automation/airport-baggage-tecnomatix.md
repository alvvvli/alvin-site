# Airport baggage flow modeled in Tecnomatix — scalable, delay-resilient operations

✈️ **Airport baggage flow modeled in Tecnomatix — scalable, delay-resilient operations.**

Prior to graduating from UC Berkeley, I self-taught Siemens **Tecnomatix** to build a digital twin of an airport baggage system integrating AGVs.

Guided by Dr. [Vishwanath Bulusu](https://www.nasa.gov/ames) (NASA Ames), the simulation demonstrated measurable efficiency gains over baseline conveyor systems, highlighting scalable potential for faster airport turnaround and reduced delays.
