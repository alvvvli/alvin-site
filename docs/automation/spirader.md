🕷️ **SPIRADER — East Japan Railway Company (JR East)’s suction-type wall-running robot.**  

Developed for **inspection and measurement on concrete infrastructure**, SPIRADER enhances **precision, safety, and operational efficiency** in railway maintenance.

### Technical Highlights
- **Suction-type adhesion** → enables stable operation on vertical and inclined concrete walls.  
- **Rebar detection sensors** → measure reinforcement positions and spacing inside structural elements.  
- **Non-destructive testing** → reduces reliance on manual drilling or destructive sampling.  
- **Data integration** → inspection outputs feed directly into JR East’s infrastructure asset management systems.  
- **Safety impact** → minimizes worker exposure to height-related risks and confined spaces.  
- **Efficiency** → faster survey cycles over large bridge and tunnel sections compared to manual inspection.

By combining **robotics** with **civil infrastructure management**, JR East demonstrates how digital inspection technologies are reshaping rail maintenance.
